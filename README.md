## About me
I'm a systems-neuroscientist and postdoc at Harvard Medical School, working with Prof. John Assad. 
My research interests include studying the role of üß†brain-circuit dynamicsüå™ in ‚¨ÖÔ∏èdecision-making‚û°Ô∏è,  üïµÔ∏èlearning and memoryüíæ, and individual differencesüß© in behavior.

## Showcase:
### Data analysis software
Python <br>
* [blechpy](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/blechpy): software for spike-sorting and analyzing electrophysiology data in the Katz lab, co-developed with [Roshan Nanu](https://github.com/nubs01). <br>
* [pyBAKS](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/pyBAKS): software for rate estimation of binary events/neuronal spikes using the BAKS algorithm, originally developed by [Nur Ahmadi](https://github.com/nurahmadi/BAKS). <br>
* [COMING SOON] cuedtaste: software for controlling and training a restaurant-style go/no-go task for rats, co-developed with [Emma Barash](https://github.com/emmalala123/lab_cuedtaste). 

MATLAB <br>
- [blechBayes](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/blechBayes): software for Bayesian classification of taste responses for in-vivo electrophysiology data

R <br>
- [repsubsamp](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/repsubsamp): software for extracting sub-samples of rows from dataframes that are statistically representative of the original data
 
### 3D-printable tools (designed in Solidworks, for printing on Formlabs SLA printers)
- [blech shuttledrive](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/blech_shuttledrive_mk6): adaptation of the [open-ephys shuttle-drive](https://github.com/open-ephys/shuttle-drive) for bilaterally targeting gustatory cortex with 64 individual electrodes. 
- [OEPS64 headstage housing](https://github.com/danielsvedberg/OEPS64_headstage_housing): a headstage protector and stabilizer for the open-ephys 64-channel hirose-connector headstage
- [COMING SOON] davis-rig fan-snorkel: a fan snorkel that creates an air curtain between an animal and a lick-spout in the Davis-rig, to prevent the animal from smelling the taste stimulus.
